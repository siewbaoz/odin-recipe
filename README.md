# odin-recipe 

in this project, i hope to have used and learn the basics of HTML.i also hope to make this projects as aesthetic as possible without using any CSS yet.

overall, after finishing this page, i realised that after you memorise html codes, it's not hard to actual startup an html page. i enjoyed this, and i hope i get to do more html soon.
